In mid-September 2023, Mr. Ma went to the scenic Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province to participate in the first Sino-German webinar on Remote Sensing observation of carbon and water cycle and chlorophyll fluorescence (by invitation, closed). The conference was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Sino-German Science Center, and co-hosted by Nanjing University and the Institute of BioGeochemistry of the Max Planck Society (referred to as the Max Planck Society) (Teacher Ma's work unit during his stay in Germany). At the meeting, dozens of scientists from many countries in Central Europe held in-depth discussions on scientific issues such as global change, ecological monitoring, remote sensing and simulation of carbon and water cycle for three days. Ms. Ma moderated the topic discussion on the second afternoon and gave a presentation entitled "Monitoring terrestrial primary productivity using geostationary satellites: progress and challenges "report.
