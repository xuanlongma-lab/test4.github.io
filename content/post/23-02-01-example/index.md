The "F5000" project was established by the Ministry of Science and Technology to better publicize and promote China's excellent scientific research results, and promote China's scientific journals and scientific research results to the world. The project uses a combination of quantitative analysis selection and peer recommendation to select the top 1% papers that are cited by each discipline in each year from China's high-quality science and technology journals.

The thesis was co-authored by Wang Minyu, an undergraduate student (who has been excluded from Zhejiang University), Luo Yi, an undergraduate student, and Zhang Zhengyang, a graduate student, under the guidance of Ms. Ma. Congratulations!
