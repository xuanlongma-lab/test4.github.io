abstract: 1.Remote sensing (RS) increasingly seeks to produce global-coverage maps of plant functional diversity (PFD) across scales. PFD can be quantified with metrics as-sessing field or RS data dissimilarity. However, their comparison suffers from the lack of normalization approaches that (1) correct for differences in the number and correlation of traits and spectral variables and (2) do not require comparing all the available samples to estimate the maximum trait's dissimilarity (unfeasible in RS).2.We propose a generalizable normalization (GN) based on the maximum potential dissimilarity for the traits and spectral data considered and compare it to more traditional approaches (e.g. the maximum dissimilarity within datasets). To do so, we simulated plant communities with radiative transfer models and compared RS-  based diversity measurements across spatial scales (α-and β-diversity com-ponents). Specifically, we assessed the capability of different normalization ap-proaches (GN, local, none) to provide PFD estimates comparable between (1) RS and plant traits and (2) estimates from different RS missions.3.Unlike the other approaches, GN provides diversity component estimates that are directly comparable between field data and RS missions with different spec-tral configurations by removing the effect of differences in the number of traits or bands and the maximum dissimilarity across datasets.4.Therefore, GN enables the separated analysis of RS images from different sensors to produce comparable global-coverage cartography. We suggest GN is neces-sary to validate RS approaches and develop interpretable maps of PFD using dif-ferent RS missions.
