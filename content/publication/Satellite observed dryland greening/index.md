abstract: A large portion of Central-Western Asia is made up of contiguous closed basins, collectively termed as the Asian Endorheic Basins (AEBs). As these retention basins are only being replenished by the intermittent and scarce rainfall, global warming coupled with ever-rising human demand for water is exerting unprecedented pressures on local water and ecological security. Recent studies revealed a persistent and widespread water storage decline across the AEBs, yet the response of dryland vegetation to this recent hydroclimatic trend and a spatially explicit partitioning of the impact into the hydroclimatic factors and human activities remain largely unknown. To fill in this knowledge gap, we conducted trend and partial correlation analysis of vegetation and hydroclimatic change from 2001 to 2021 using multi-satellite observations, including vegetation greenness, total water storage anomalies (TWSA) and meteorological data. Here we show that much of the AEB (65.53 %), encompassing Mongolia Plateau, Northwest China, Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and Western Asia (except the Arabian Peninsula), exhibited a significant greening trend over the past two decades. In arid AEB, precipitation dominated the vegetation productivity trend. Such a rainfall dominance gave way to TWSA dominance in the hyper-arid AEB. We further showed that the decoupling of rainfall and hyper-arid vegetation greening was largely due to a significant expansion (17.3 %) in irrigated cropland across the hyper-arid AEB. Given the extremely harsh environment in the AEB, our results therefore raised a significant concern on the ecological and societal sustainability in this region, where a mild increase in precipitation cannot catch up the rising evaporative demand and water consumption resulted from global warming and agriculture intensification.
